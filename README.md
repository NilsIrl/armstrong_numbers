# armstrong_numbers

High performance ~~multithreaded~~ armstrong numbers

# Usage

```bash
$ cargo run -- --help
```

This program accepts input in 3 different ways:

1. Interactive

```bash
$ cargo run
Please enter a number to be tested: **9**
9 is an Armstrong number.
Please enter a number to be tested: **10**
10 isn't Armstrong number.
Please enter a number to be tested: **153**
153 is an Armstrong number.
Please enter a number to be tested: **154**
154 isn't an Armstrong number.
Please enter a number to be tested: **<C-d>**
Goodbye ğŸ‘‹
```

`CTRL+D` cuts standard input causing the program to stop, like you would with
other interactive UNIX programs.
